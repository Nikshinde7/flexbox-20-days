Create a mobile app layout with Flexbox

We tried to create a responsiveee mobile app UI, but without using media queries, no floats. no widhts, no heights! Ah, that took a while to do, but it was worth it!

So, if we would have tried to create the same UI with box-model. Yeah it would have taken a lot of time & a lot of floats, margins, padding & whatnot!! But with the power of the mighty flexbox, just few lines are enough!
